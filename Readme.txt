Just download the .exe
First time opening may take a while, it will download the initial data

Things that work (still take it with a grain of salt): 
Range in straight line
Comparing between 2 missiles

Things that sort of work: 
Loft isn't 100% right, it can somewhat work for some missiles but don't expect to be accurate with lofting missiles

Things that don't work: 
Turn performance is merely a suggestion of what the missile could do compared to other things; don't trust it and always prefer to test in game

Default entries are 1224km/h TAS for the launch plane, 1km altitude and the target is not taken into account.
The simulation works up to 20km altitude
